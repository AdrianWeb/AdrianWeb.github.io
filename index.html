            website for a fictional arts and crafts store using the tools on
            your own computer. This project will provide you with less guidance
            than previous projects. You should expect to use the internet,
            Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that
            you cannot easily solve."

            Original description: "In this project, you’ll be building your own
            basic design system for a website. In essence, you’ll be building a
            website to help you build MORE websites in the future! On your site,
            you’ll collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating
            styles."

          <p>
            Original description: "In this project, you will create a fictional
            tea shop website on your own computer. We will provide a design spec
            and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an
            image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and
            values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of
            instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will
            be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance."

            Original description: "For this project, you will build a personal
            portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects
            that you build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will
            have a main page that features different projects that you’ve built
            and another page that contains contact information, in case someone
            wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages
            for each project, detailing the technology used."

            functions to power a small guessing game. Your code will run in the
            browser instead of the terminal, and you can use your browser’s
            console to help you test your functions and view any syntax errors."
